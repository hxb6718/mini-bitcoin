[Bitcoin / *Mini-Bitcoin White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (*except Merkle-tree)

## Requirements

You need install to run
* git
* docker

and (for developers)
* Java
* Eclipse IDE (recommended)
* docker-compose (recommended)

## How To GO - Users

```
docker pull soldate/mbtc
docker run -it -p 10762:10762 -p 8080:8080 -v "${PWD}/data:/tmp/data" --rm soldate/mbtc
```

## How To GO - Developers

For the first time, do

```
git clone https://github.com/hxb6718/mini-bitcoin.git
```

Then

```
cd mini-bitcoin/
git pull
docker build -t mbtc .
docker run -it -p 10762:10762 -p 8080:8080 -v "${PWD}/data:/tmp/data" --rm mbtc
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Understanding the code

Inside mbtc.Main you get the "main method" starting point.

Put a breakpoint in the first line and go debugging. :-)

## Docker-compose
This commands below will start two nodes, so you can check how the peers exchange messages. 

``` 
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

After this, maybe you want to start another peer in your favorite IDE for debugging.

To stop, type in another terminal

``` 
$ docker-compose down
```

## What is address?
It's just a shortcut to the public key. Once your public key is on the blockchain, you will receive coins using small 
address, instead of use the large public key.

Example: 

```
publicKey: MFYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAAoDQgAEiCEOTeXDzM8lDlj21vmzQxzu9w6aN8f98uq3fSBwBQtL627QBvH0Rk8xsT9leiYtByp815SNPEcxS0cFXEm4IA==

address: 4d744-2
```
You can use (to send 1 mbtc):

```
/send 1 4d744-2 
```

Or (IF the publickey is not in the blockchain yet.)

```
/send 1 MFYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAAoDQgAEiCEOTeXDzM8lDlj21vmzQxzu9w6aN8f98uq3fSBwBQtL627QBvH0Rk8xsT9leiYtByp815SNPEcxS0cFXEm4IA==
```

More than 4 billions of possible addresses.
